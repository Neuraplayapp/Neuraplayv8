# AI Tool Calling System Guide

## Overview

NeuraPlay's AI Assistant now has a sophisticated tool calling system that allows the AI to proactively help users by executing actions, not just providing text responses. The system works in both **conversation mode** and **text mode** with different behaviors optimized for each context.

## How It Works

### Architecture

1. **AIService.ts** - Enhanced with tool calling capabilities
2. **ToolExecutorService.ts** - Handles actual tool execution
3. **AIAssistant.tsx** - Orchestrates tool calling in different modes

### Two Modes of Operation

#### 1. Text Mode (Full Tool Calling)
- **When**: User is typing messages or using single voice recordings
- **Behavior**: AI can use all available tools proactively
- **Use Cases**: 
  - "Take me to the playground" → Navigates automatically
  - "I'm colorblind" → Tests colors, configures accessibility
  - "Make text bigger" → Updates font size settings

#### 2. Conversation Mode (Limited Tool Calling)
- **When**: User is in continuous voice conversation with AI
- **Behavior**: AI focuses on natural conversation but can still use tools for urgent needs
- **Tool Usage**: Only for accessibility, critical settings, and navigation when user seems lost
- **Use Cases**:
  - Accessibility needs are always handled immediately
  - Critical settings (mute, disable animations) for user comfort
  - Navigation when user expresses confusion

## Available Tools

### 1. navigate_to_page
**Purpose**: Navigate to specific pages in the application
```json
{
  "name": "navigate_to_page",
  "parameters": {
    "page": "playground|dashboard|forum|profile|home|about",
    "reason": "Why navigating to this page"
  }
}
```

**Triggers**:
- "Take me to the playground"
- "Show me the dashboard"
- "Go to my profile"

### 2. update_setting
**Purpose**: Update user preferences and settings
```json
{
  "name": "update_setting", 
  "parameters": {
    "setting": "theme|fontSize|accessibility|colorBlindMode|highContrast",
    "value": "Setting value",
    "reason": "Why updating this setting"
  }
}
```

**Triggers**:
- "Make text bigger"
- "Turn on dark mode"
- "Enable high contrast"
- "I'm colorblind"

### 3. recommend_games
**Purpose**: Recommend games based on learning goals
```json
{
  "name": "recommend_games",
  "parameters": {
    "skill": "math|reading|memory|coordination|problem_solving",
    "difficulty": "easy|medium|hard",
    "reason": "Why recommending these games"
  }
}
```

**Triggers**:
- "I want to improve my math"
- "Help me with reading"
- "I need memory practice"

### 4. create_content
**Purpose**: Create personalized content
```json
{
  "name": "create_content",
  "parameters": {
    "type": "diary_prompt|calendar_entry|forum_post",
    "content": "The content to create",
    "personalization": "How it's personalized"
  }
}
```

**Triggers**:
- "Create a diary prompt for me"
- "Schedule study time"
- "Help me write a forum post"

### 5. accessibility_support
**Purpose**: Provide accessibility accommodations
```json
{
  "name": "accessibility_support",
  "parameters": {
    "type": "color_blindness|dyslexia|motor_skills",
    "action": "test|configure|enable|disable",
    "details": "Additional details"
  }
}
```

**Triggers**:
- "I can't see colors well"
- "I have dyslexia"
- "Make it easier to click buttons"

### 6. read_user_data
**Purpose**: Read user data and activity
```json
{
  "name": "read_user_data",
  "parameters": {
    "data_type": "notifications|progress|forum_posts|diary_entries",
    "filter": "Optional filter"
  }
}
```

**Triggers**:
- "Show my notifications"
- "What's my progress?"
- "Read my diary entries"

## Implementation Details

### AI Response Parsing

The system supports two formats for tool calls:

#### 1. Enhanced Format (JSON)
```text
AI Response: "I'll help you with that! [TOOL_CALL]{"name": "navigate_to_page", "parameters": {"page": "playground", "reason": "User wants to practice"}}[/TOOL_CALL] Let's go explore the games!"
```

#### 2. Fallback Format (Text Parsing)
```text
AI Response: "🚀 Taking you to the playground! Let's find some great games for you."
```
*System detects "Taking you to" and creates navigation tool call*

### Context Integration

Tool calls receive rich context:
```javascript
const context = {
  currentPage: location.pathname,
  mode: 'text' | 'conversing',
  user: { id: 'user_id', name: 'User Name' },
  timestamp: new Date()
};
```

### Error Handling

- **Tool Execution Failures**: Gracefully handled with user-friendly messages
- **API Failures**: Falls back to direct API calls
- **Parse Errors**: Uses text-based parsing as fallback

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Accessibility Support
```
User: "I have trouble seeing colors"
AI: "I'll help you with color vision! Let me set up some tests."
→ Tool: accessibility_support(type: "color_blindness", action: "test")
→ Result: Navigation to color test, UI adjustments
```

### Example 2: Learning Support  
```
User: "I want to get better at math"
AI: "Great! Let me recommend some perfect math games for you."
→ Tool: recommend_games(skill: "math", difficulty: "medium")
→ Tool: navigate_to_page(page: "playground")
→ Result: Game recommendations + automatic navigation
```

### Example 3: Settings Management
```
User: "The text is too small"
AI: "I'll make the text bigger for you right away!"
→ Tool: update_setting(setting: "fontSize", value: "large")
→ Result: Font size increased immediately
```

## Benefits

### For Users
- **Proactive Assistance**: AI takes action, not just gives advice
- **Seamless Experience**: No need to manually navigate or change settings
- **Accessibility First**: Immediate accommodations for special needs
- **Context Aware**: Actions are relevant to current situation

### For Developers
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new tools
- **Robust**: Multiple fallback mechanisms
- **Observable**: Comprehensive logging and error handling
- **Flexible**: Works with different AI backends

## Future Enhancements

1. **Advanced Tool Chaining**: Combine multiple tools in sequence
2. **User Permission System**: Ask before executing certain tools
3. **Tool Learning**: AI learns user preferences for tool usage
4. **Voice Tool Confirmation**: Audio feedback for tool execution
5. **Custom Tool Creation**: Users can define their own tools

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Tools Not Executing**
   - Check console for tool parsing errors
   - Verify ToolExecutorService is initialized
   - Ensure context is properly passed

2. **Wrong Tool Selected**
   - Review tool descriptions and triggers
   - Update AI system prompt for better tool selection
   - Add more specific keyword detection

3. **Tool Execution Errors**
   - Check individual tool implementations
   - Verify required services are available (NavigationService, etc.)
   - Review error logs for specific failures

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed logging:
```javascript
// In development mode
console.log('🔧 Tool Call:', toolCall);
console.log('📊 Context:', context);
console.log('✅ Result:', result);
```
