# The Cube - NeuraPlay AI Platform

## About This Game

Welcome to **The Cube**, a sophisticated 3D Rubik's Cube puzzle game designed specifically for cognitive development and neuropsychological training. This isn't just a puzzle game‚Äîit's a scientifically-backed learning tool that targets 22 specific neuropsychological concepts.

### üß† Educational Value

**The Cube** is more than entertainment; it's a comprehensive cognitive training tool that engages multiple brain systems simultaneously. Each move you make activates specific neural pathways, making this an ideal platform for developing:

- **Spatial Reasoning**: Understanding 3D relationships and transformations
- **Working Memory**: Holding multiple piece positions in mind
- **Executive Function**: Planning and executing complex sequences
- **Problem Solving**: Analyzing patterns and finding solutions
- **Motor Skills**: Precise finger movements and coordination

3. **Attention Control** - Sustained focus during solving
4. **Cognitive Flexibility** - Adapting strategies to new configurations
5. **Inhibitory Control** - Suppressing incorrect moves
6. **Planning** - Strategic approach to solving
7. **Problem Solving** - Logical analysis of cube state
8. **Decision Making** - Choosing optimal moves
9. **Spatial Reasoning** - 3D spatial manipulation
10. **Visual Memory** - Remembering patterns and positions
11. **Sequential Processing** - Executing move sequences
12. **Fluid Reasoning** - Adapting to novel situations
13. **Processing Efficiency** - Speed and accuracy improvement
14. **Cognitive Load** - Managing multiple pieces of information
15. **Sustained Attention** - Maintaining focus over time
16. **Selective Attention** - Focusing on relevant pieces
17. **Response Inhibition** - Avoiding impulsive moves
18. **Task Switching** - Moving between different solving phases
19. **Goal Setting** - Setting sub-goals (faces, layers)
20. **Self-Monitoring** - Tracking progress and errors
21. **Error Detection** - Identifying and correcting mistakes
22. **Motor Skills** - Precise finger movements

### üéÆ How It Works

The game tracks your every move and analyzes your solving patterns to provide insights into your cognitive development. As you solve the cube, the system:

- **Monitors Progress**: Tracks solve percentage in real-time
- **Analyzes Moves**: Maps each move to specific neuropsychological concepts
- **Generates Reports**: Creates detailed cognitive development analysis
- **Awards Points**: Gives XP and stars based on efficiency and time
- **Provides Feedback**: Offers personalized learning insights

### üèÜ Performance Tracking

Your solving sessions are automatically analyzed to provide:

- **Session Statistics**: Total moves, solve time, efficiency score
- **Progress Curves**: Visual representation of your solving journey
- **Concept Mapping**: Which neuropsychological skills you're developing
- **AI Analysis**: Personalized cognitive development reports
- **Achievement Tracking**: XP and stars for motivation
